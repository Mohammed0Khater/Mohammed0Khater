## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Mohammed0Khater/Mohammed0Khater** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

IHere are some ideas to get you started:
I'm currently working on practicing CCNA labs in Cisco Packet Tracer to apply some fundamental networking concepts. Hopefully I will be able to move on from that into Cloud Engineering by starting with the AWS Practiotioner-Associate Course or the AZ900 Course.

You can reach me via my emial: mohammedkhater013@gmail.com
Feel free to contact me about any better approaches to take for my roadmap.
